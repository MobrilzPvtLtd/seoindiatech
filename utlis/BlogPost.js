While it is true that the way we use the internet is shifting, it does not mean SEO is over. In fact, AI SEO changes where you appear, but it doesn’t eliminate the need for your expertise. This guide will help you understand this new landscape and show you how to adapt.',

They don't need to click your site to read a 500-word article about it. This means traffic for basic, factual information may go down.`,
          `<strong>More Importance on Clear Answers:</strong> Google’s AI is looking for "answer blocks". If your content is the clearest and most direct answer to a question, Google is more likely to feature you as the source.`,
          `<strong>Increased Competition for Visibility:</strong> Because the AI box takes up so much space, the "top spot" is more valuable than ever. However, the AI often cites 3–5 different websites at once. This gives smaller websites a chance to be seen alongside much larger brands if their content is better structured.`,
